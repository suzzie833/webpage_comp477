	<p>Newton’s cradle is a device used to demonstrate the conservation of momentum and energy. It has multiple 
	spheres that are dangling by ropes or wires while attached to a metal frame. To demonstrate, we lift one of 
	the spheres from one end and release to have it swing freely, so it collides with the other spheres in the middle. 
	Upon collision, the force transfers through the center spheres and the sphere on the opposite end will swing upwards. 
	That sphere will then swing back down and repeat the notion again. As a result, the energy being transferred between 
	each spheres will not lose that momentum; thus demonstrating the conservation of momentum.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Objectives</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
	<p>For our final project, we have decided to create a physics-based simulation of a Newton’s Cradle in 3D. The project 
	allows the user to modify certain aspects of the cradle, such as the number of balls or its starting position. The 
	simulation will be built in such a way as to let the user be able to select and modify their variables as they see 
	fit. The objective of this simulation is to develop an environment where the program runs depending on the values 
	input by the user in order to create a multitude of scenarios of varying combinations of parameters. These parameters 
	would be used in a simulated physics environment to recreate the action that would be observed from the collision and 
	the transferal of energy of the physical balls in a real-life newton’s cradle.</p>
	<p>To recreate the device, physics is needed. To start off, we need to have constant variables such as acceleration, 
	which is the gravity, mass, and radius of the sphere.</p>
	<p>G = 9.82 m/s^2</p>
	<p>The mass and the radius of the sphere will also be kept constant. However, the value can be fixed to any number. 
	The higher the mass and the height, the faster the velocity. These variables will be used for Newton’s law of motion, 
	which the mass and acceleration are used to find the force used in the device.</p>

  <!-- Issues -->
  <div class="w3-container" id="issues" style="margin-top:75px">
    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Issues</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>We had encountered some difficulties in implementing Newton’s Cradle. For one, It was difficult to move the 
	spheres with the mouse since we needed to get the coordinates of the mouse in worlds coordinates. As a result, 
	the ball was not in the same position as the mouse. The worlds coordinate is important to find the angles needed 
	to rotate the ball. However, it still moves in the same direction of the mouse which was good enough. Secondly, 
	there was a problem with the collisions between the spheres. When one of the balls collided with the one that is 
	already in motion, it increase the velocity, which is not what we wanted. It happened only when more than 2 balls 
	swung at the same time. The implementation of camera was a bit difficult because while the camera was in motion, 
	the balls moved faster as well. If the camera stopped moving, the ball’s velocity went back to normal. There was 
	also a problem when we wanted to lift two or more sphere. The spheres would be lifted if the initial one pushed 
	them. However, the lifted spheres would stay immobile if we decided to rotate the selected sphere downwards. There 
	was also problems with making both spheres adjustable on both sides without breaking the collider. There is now a 
	different part of the collider for moving spheres when the animation is not playing.</p>
